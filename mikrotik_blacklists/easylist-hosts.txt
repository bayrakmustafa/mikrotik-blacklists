# Easylist, parsed and mirrored by https://firebog.net
# Updated 11JUL25 from https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt

# This is sourced from an "adblock" style list which is flat-out NOT designed to work with DNS sinkholes
# There WILL be mistakes with how this is parsed, due to how domain names are extracted and exceptions handled
# Please bring any parsing issues up at https://github.com/WaLLy3K/wally3k.github.io/issues prior to raising a request upstream

# If your issue IS STILL PRESENT when using uBlock/ABP/etc, you should request a correction at https://github.com/easylist/easylist#list-issues
